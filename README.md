class-sort
=========
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/wesselbaum/class-sort.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/wesselbaum/class-sort)

This project is meant to sort class attributes in a html file for better readability.
 
In current version no files will be overwritten, but a file with extension '_sorted.html' will be put next to the original one. In next versions this will be changed, when I can confirm the functionality the way this tool is meant to deliver.

## Installation

  `npm install -g class-sort`

## Usage

  `class-sort path/to/directory`
  
  `class-sort path/to/file`
  
## Tests

  `npm test`
